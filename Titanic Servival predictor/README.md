# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based classification model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The model analyzes passenger attributes such as age, gender, class, and fare to determine the likelihood of survival. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using a real-world dataset.

This is a classic machine learning classification project developed for practical understanding of supervised learning.
