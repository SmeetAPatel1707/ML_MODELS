# IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based sentiment analysis system for movie reviews using the IMDB dataset. The objective is to classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on textual content. The project focuses on natural language processing (NLP), text preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning techniques.

The model is developed as part of hands-on practice in NLP and machine learning.
