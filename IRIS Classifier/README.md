# IRIS Flower Classification Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning classification model using the **IRIS flower dataset**. The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species—**Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica**—based on sepal and petal measurements. The project focuses on understanding classification workflows, data exploration, and model evaluation.

This is a foundational machine learning project developed for academic learning and practical understanding.
