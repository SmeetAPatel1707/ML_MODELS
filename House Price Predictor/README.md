# House Price Predictor Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based house price prediction system using regression techniques. The goal of the project is to predict residential property prices based on various numerical and categorical features. The implementation focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using structured housing data.

The project is based on the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset and is developed as part of hands-on machine learning practice.
